# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This repository is dedicated to the final project of "Getting and Cleaning Data" course which I took within Data Science specialization offered by Coursera.

In this repository you can find the following:

1. *run_analysis* script that performs all the necessary steps outlined in the project description:
  * Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  * Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  * Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  * Labelling the data set with descriptive variable names.
  * From the data set in step 4, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each       subject.
  It also provides detailed comments on each of the steps as well as justifications if needed.
  
2. *CodeBook.md* and *CodeBook.xlsx* files - the former file informs where a code book is stored, whereas the latter is essentially a data dictionary, describing all variables that one can find in the data set.
