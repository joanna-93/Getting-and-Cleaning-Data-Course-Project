# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This repository is dedicated to the final project of "Getting and Cleaning Data" course which I took within Data Science specialization offered by Coursera.

In this repository you can find the following:

1. *run_analysis* script that performs all the necessary steps outlined in the project description:
  * Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  * Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  * Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  * Labelling the data set with descriptive variable names.
  * From the data set in step 4, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each       subject.
2. *CodeBook.md* file which is essentially a data dictionary for the data set created, it describes all variables that one can find in the data set.
